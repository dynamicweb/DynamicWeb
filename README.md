# Welcome to the DynamicWeb Community Hub

Here you have the chance to influence the future direction of DynamicWeb. To do this you can go to the **Issues** tab and submit your wishes and ideas for new functionality in DynamicWeb or Swift. 

## Before submitting a feature request
If you are unsure if the functionality you are requesting is already available, please consult the [DynamicWeb documentation](https://doc.dynamicweb.dev).

Try to see if the wish/idea has already been submitted by someone else, by using the search functionality inside the **Issues** tab.

## Up-voting a Feature Request
If you see a feature request that you also belive is a good idea, then you can upvote that feature request using the +1/"üëç" reaction to the issue description. If the feature request has enough upvotes we will look into the idea and potentially add it to the backlog.
